# MNIST digit predictor with react and flask

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application that allows users to draw digits (0-9) on a canvas, which is then sent to a backend API using flask. The backend uses a PyTorch convolutional neural network model, trained on the MNIST dataset to predict the drawn digit.
